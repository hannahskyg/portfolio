        <p>Skills Used: Python, HTML, Pandas, Plotly, Scikit-Learn</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Predicted player positions with 77.3% accuracy by performing exploratory data analysis on 19,692 rows and 161 columns
from 2025 competitive League of Legends matches, identifying key features such as kills, deaths, DPM, and
monster/minion kills</li>
            <li>Ensured unbiased model performance by conducting hypothesis testing and fairness analysis across low- and high-kill
groups (p-value = 0.056), validating parity in position prediction</li>
                <li>Improved predictive accuracy by 4% over baseline by engineering combined metrics (e.g., total kills, objective
contributions) and scaling features, translating complex gameplay data into actionable insights for competitive strategy
analysis</li>
